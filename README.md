In an attempt to make a statement as part of the historic WWE RAW debut on Netflix, Hogan took a risk during the segment by ripping off his shirt to expose a “Netflix Is RAW” shirt.

When WWE RAW debuted on Netflix on January 6, 2025, from the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, two-time WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan faced a furious response.

The Los Angeles audience had conflicting feelings about Hogan's attendance at this historic show, despite his famous position. Here's an examination of the reasons for the ferocious jeering directed at Hogan and his longtime manager, Jimmy Hart.

Hogan tried to engage the audience when he and Hart entered the stage in the closing seconds of the performance. He talked about how being a member of WWE had been the "greatest part of his life," but the audience's reaction was mostly hostile despite his attempts to interact.

Hogan thanked the crowd for their support throughout the years, but most of them booed in response, with a few applause emerging.
